# EntomologyDB

This is a Database built on MariaDB to hold facts about entomological species, as well as the specimen held by the Mid-America Entomological Archive and the requests made for these specimen. HTML and PHP are used to allow access to the database. 

mission_and_objectives, tables_fields_and_primary_keys, table_relationships, business_rules, and the Final Design Document all contain design information.

PHP contains all of the PHP pages for this project.

SQL contains all of the SQL scripts for this project. Running the script "build.sql" will build the full database to its initial base state.
