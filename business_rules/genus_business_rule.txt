RULE INFORMATION

Statement:  Scientifically, all species fall directly under a genus. This genus, when combined with its binomial name, uniquely identifies each species. This genus must fall under a family in the taxonomic hierarchy, so it must have a supertaxon.

Constraint: All taxon used as a foreign key in species must have a supertaxon.
