The purpose of the Mid-America Entomological database is to maintain and provide 
information about entomological species for individuals such as researchers, 
landowners, and outdoor enthusiasts. We also aim to allow researchers to request 
specimen samples and facilitate the staff in sending the samples.

Comment: It's one of the primary ones, but responding to specimine requests is
still an objective, and I wouldn't include it in your mission statement.
